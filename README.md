# Machine Learning Programming Exercises.

Stanford's Machine Learning course on Coursera uses the Octave/MATLAB
programming language. This is a Python port of the programming exercises
using Jupyter notebooks running Python 3.

I took the online offering of the course this summer and had wanted to
understand it properly. What had started as an exercise in
reverse-engineering Octave code ended up being a full translation of all
of the exercises.

Following the Coursera Honor Code, all solutions have been removed.


## Contributing

The course on Coursera uses a custom submission script to submit solutions
to the Coursera interface. I don't plan to port that to Python anytime soon
so will gladly merge pull requests. Please put all relevant code in the
common `mlcourse` module.
